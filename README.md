[Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/) is a site where there are algorithmic problems.  
They can be solved in competition or whenever.

I solve all theses problems in C++, but the language is not imposed.

I have implemented [readme_maker.exe](readme_maker.exe) to automatically create readme files. [(source code)](readme_maker.cpp)

I manually set the title and the link corresponding to each problem.

You can directly launch it or you can use the command :
```bash
readme_maker.exe
```
It will show the list of the readme files created.

If you want to overwrite them, use the command :
```bash
readme_maker.exe -f
```
